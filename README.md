## Covid-19 Questionnaire Website

The group wanted to create an easy usable website page in which users will complete their Covid-19 symptoms questionnaire. The answers to the questionnaire informs the user if they are showing Covid-19 symptoms and if they should take a Covid test. 

The user signs up or logs in using their email which is implemeted using SSO and then the data is recorded in our database.

We used React Native to construct our questionnaire. 
As it is known that some symptoms are the early showing and most persistent ones for Covid. Thus, we decided that if the user inputs that they have a fever, and if they have loss of taste or smell we inqure them to get Covid tested. the same information is given in the user also inputs that they have all the symptoms. However, if they do not have the combination that is indicated above we do not recommend to get tested.
